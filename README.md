# plssemsim
###### Current release: 0.1.0
###### Stata version required: at least 15.1
Stata package for simulating data in accordance with a given Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM). The package has been developed in line with the `cSEM.DGP` `R` package (https://m-e-rademaker.github.io/cSEM.DGP), while it adds the simulation of data using copulas.

The companion package for estimating PLS-SEM models is available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/sergioventurini/plssem.

# Installation notes
